Notes:

- Pass props to the ui element in jsx as a name=value
- In the constructor of the component read the props and then use
them to set the state. 

Experiment:
--
This Branch was created to experiment with a stateengine and passing
functions as property to a component to use as a callback.

- No further work should be done in this branch. It only exists as a reference.
(unless its related to these experiments )
